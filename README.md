# Airbnb Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

	* Clean the dataset by removing unnecessary variables and fixing NA values.
	* Summarize the dataset with tables.
	* Visualize the dataset with scatterplots and density plots.
	* Provide some insights on the relationship between variables.
	* Check for correlation between any two variables using a correlation plot.

The output should be an HTML markdown document.
